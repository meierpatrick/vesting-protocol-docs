# Getting Started

Getting started is super easy.

{% hint style="info" %}
First, make sure you have: [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/), [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
{% endhint %}

Open a terminal window and run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/share-dapp.git
cd share-dapp
yarn install
```

The above will clone the Share repository and install the necessary dependencies.
