# â›“ Atomic Swap

## Introduction

This application is used to swap atoms between our two native tokens, from Ethereum to the Binance Smart Chain and back.

{% hint style="info" %}
An Atomic Swap is a smart contract technology which makes possible to exchange coins from two different blockchains without having to trust any third party.
{% endhint %}

Between two bridges of Ethereum - BSC, there are 2 relayers to be able to mint corresponding tokens when swapping between those two blockchains.

There will be validators at each bridge to verify the atomic swaps, when **75%** consensus is reached, the transaction will be executed by the relayer.
